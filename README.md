## Sudoku Solver
You have to input a sudoku in the gui and press the button 'Solve Sudoku'
Then after you will get the solved sudoku on the other side.

## Future Plans
- Scope of our project is that we can also add an algorithm which will generate Sudoku on its own.
- We can also improve our GUI to make it more user friendly.
- The concepts of backtracking and probability can be further applied on the problem of Encryption and Decryption of Data. We can provide the user with an unsolved Sudoku whose answer will be the key for the encrypted data.
